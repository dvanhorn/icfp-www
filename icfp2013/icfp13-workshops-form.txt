   (Note that this list must be reviewed by SIGPLAN, which includes
    checking for broad representation.

      http://www.sigplan.org/DiversityPolicy.htm 

    Since SIGPLAN does sometimes request changes, PC invitations
    should wait until the workshop is approved.  Thus, you may
    wish to include alternate names, in case not all invitations
    are accepted.

    The ICFP Workshop Chairs will pass this proposed PC on to 
    SIGPLAN, and report back if there are any concerns.)
