         CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                            ICFP 2013
 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                     September 22 - 28, 2013
                   Boston, Massachusetts, USA
               http://icfpconference.org/icfp2013/

The 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Boston, Massachusetts on September 22-28,
2013.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2013 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN.  These events should be more informal and focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and foster the exchange of new ideas.  The preference is for one-day
events, but other schedules can also be considered.

The workshops are scheduled to occur on September 22-24 (the three
days before ICFP) and September 28 (the day after ICFP).
